        <p id="text">
          Eurobeat refers to two styles of dance music that originated in Europe in the 1980s: one is a British variant of Italian Eurodisco-influenced
          dance-pop, and the other is a hi-NRG-driven form of Italo disco.
          <br />
          Eurobeat is characterized by a very high and fast tempo, ranging from 138 to 185 BPM, with a great emphasis on melody and by generally containing
          simple, extravagant and sometimes nonsensical lyrics.
